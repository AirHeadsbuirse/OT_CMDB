Normalize

Below is a concrete layout for each minimal sheet and where your existing columns land.

1) Sites (merge all “Reference Sites” into this)

Grain: 1 row = 1 site (NEC, CO, Lab, Hub, Cell Site, etc.)

Sheet name: Sites

Columns:

Site_Code (PK, from Site Code)

CLLI

Site_Name

Site_Type (NEC, CO, Lab, Hub, Cell Site, …)

Network (OT Core, Wireless, Lab, etc.)

Priority_Band (P0, P1, P2, etc.)

Address

City

State

Postal_Code

Region

Affiliate

System_ID

Latitude

Longitude

Primary_Contact

Primary_Contact_Email

Notes

From existing:

Entire Reference_Sites.csv → this sheet.

In Assets, Site/Location should be a FK → Sites.Site_Code (e.g., HAYSVAXA).

2) Networks_IPs (normalize your Reference_IPs)

Grain: 1 row = 1 IP address or IP template for a device role at a site.

Sheet name: Networks_IPs

Columns:

IP_UID (PK, e.g., IP-000001 – you can generate or let Apps Script handle)

Site_Code (FK → Sites.Site_Code)

CLLI

IP_Address

Subnet

CIDR

VLAN_ID

Device_Role (PLC, HMI, OT Switch, SCADA, UPS, etc.)

Device_Name (friendly name or expected hostname)

Network_Segment (L2 Control Network, L3 Site Operations, L1 Power Network, etc.)

Gateway_IP_Device

Open_Ports_Template

OT_IT_Network (OT / IT)

Notes

From existing:

Reference_IPs.csv → becomes this sheet (with deduped header once).

In Assets, IP Address, Network Segment, Open Ports, Gateway IP/Device, Network could optionally reference this sheet:

Either:

Keep those as direct columns on Assets, or

Add IP_UID to Assets and look up IP details via formula/Apps Script.

For minimal sheet count but still clean structure, I’d keep the Networks_IPs sheet and leave Assets with direct IP info for now. Later you can migrate to IP_UID once the model stabilizes.

3) Assets (your main CMDB table)

Grain: 1 row = 1 OT asset (PLC/HMI/switch/server/etc.)

Sheet name: Assets

Columns (normalized names, same content):

Asset_UID (PK)

Asset_Type (PLC, HMI, OT Switch, SCADA Server, Historian, UPS…)

Asset_Category (Field Device, Compute, Network, Power, Security, etc.)

Manufacturer

Model_Version (rename of Model/Version)

Serial_Asset_ID

Site_Code (FK → Sites.Site_Code, from Site/Location)

Zone_Process_Area (e.g., Boiler Room, MCC-1, Control Room)

Site_Type (copy from Sites or drop if redundant – NEC/CO/Lab)

Network (OT Core, Wireless, Lab, etc.)

Network_Segment (L2 Control Network, L3 Site Operations, etc.)

IP_Address

Open_Ports

Gateway_IP_Device

VAST_ID (FK to external system, but just keep as code for now)

Owner_Responsible_Party

Deployment_Date

Last_Verified

Priority_Band (P0 – Safety / Life, P1 – Critical Service, etc.)

Criticality (Safety, Production-Critical, Support, etc.)

Risk_Category (High, Medium, etc.)

Government (Y/N)

Remote_Access_Enabled (Yes/No)

AOLR_in_CyberArk (No/In CyberArk/etc.)

Splunk_Logging (Direct to Splunk/Via Gateway Device/None)

CyberVault_Backup (Yes/No/Planned)

Maintenance_Schedule

Firmware_Software_Ver

Documentation_Link

Network_Map_Link

State_Status (Active, Retired, Planned…)

Notes

Created_By

Created_Date

Modified_By

Modified_Date

From existing:

This is essentially your Assets.csv with:

Site/Location → Site_Code

Model/Version → Model_Version

Serial/Asset ID → Serial_Asset_ID

You can later add validation lists for: Priority_Band, Criticality, Risk_Category, etc., instead of making extra sheets.

4) Asset_Relationships

Grain: 1 row = 1 directed relationship between two assets.

Sheet name: Asset_Relationships

Columns:

Relationship_UID (PK)

Parent_Asset_UID (FK → Assets.Asset_UID)

Child_Asset_UID (FK → Assets.Asset_UID)

Relationship_Type (Controls, Monitors, Depends On, Communicates With, Protects, Hosted On, Connected To, Powers, etc.)

Dependency_Level (Hard / Soft / Informational)

Created_Date

Verified_Date

Notes

From existing:

Your Asset_Relationships.csv maps straight into this with no structural changes needed.

5) Asset_Audit_Log (even though you didn’t paste it here)

Grain: 1 row = one change event (append-only).

Sheet name: Asset_Audit_Log

Columns (recommended minimal):

Audit_UID (PK)

Asset_UID (FK → Assets.Asset_UID)

Change_Timestamp

Change_Type (Create / Update / Delete / Verify / Discovery)

Changed_By

Field_Name

Old_Value

New_Value

Change_Source (Manual, Import, Script, API, Scan, etc.)

Notes

You already mentioned Asset_Audit_Log.csv in your earlier spec – this is the place it lives. Different grain than Assets, so it really should stay its own sheet.

TL;DR – Minimal Sheet Set

1. Sites
Physical/logical locations, CLLI, priority, contacts.

2. Networks_IPs
IP/VLAN catalog and device-role templates per site.

3. Assets
All OT CIs with site, IP, risk, logging, and governance metadata.

4. Asset_Relationships
Graph edges: parent/child, “Controls / Monitors / Depends On / Communicates With / Hosted On / Protects / Powers”.
